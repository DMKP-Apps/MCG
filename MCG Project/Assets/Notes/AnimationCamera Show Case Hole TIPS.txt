### NOTES on Animation Camera

THE “Tee” designates the direction / rotation the first cannon shot is facing.

For example, Y “rotation" of 180

The Final Path Point LOCATION of the camera should follow this formula:

The location of the TEE

(i.e. -42, 0, 185) 

Plus the OFFSET of the “Cannon > Cannon > Camera Position”

(i.e. 0, 8.5, -11)

important ---> PLUS 0.1 Y

Resulting in 

(i.e. -42, 8.6, absolute value 196)

for some stepping reason, setting Y to 8.5 gives one last jitter and setting to 8.6 is completely seamless


The Final Path Point ROTATION of the camera should follow this formula:

The Shot camera is calculated by looking at the “Cannon > Cannon > Firing Position” so the rotation of the angle is calculated at runtime...Run the preview in Unity, a Cannon(Clone) > Main Camera rotation is created to read the values (i.e. X 22.825 -  Y -1.235  -  Z 0)

Set the rotation to X of the Cloned Camera, and Y is the rotation of the TEE minus the rotation of the cloned camera.

For example 180 rotated tee minus 1.235 runtime camera = Animation camera rotation Y of 178.765

Set Z to .00001

(i.e. Angle X 22.825, Y 178.765, Z 0.00001)
